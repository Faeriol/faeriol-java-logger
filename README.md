# faeriol-java-logger

Finding myself in situations where basic logging would be useful but most Logging tools seem too fancy, I quickly implemented this to have something to use.
IT IS STILL INCOMPLETE. I will only add features as I need them, so don't expect miracles.

## Usage
Pull out the source, read it. Code is short and stupid and enough (2 classes so far) that it should not be hard to use.
Package is me.faeriol.utils

## Development
It's Java!
This package attempts to remain as small, portable and independant as possible.
That is: It should never rely on external packages.
